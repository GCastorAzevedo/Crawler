Crawler is a small project initiated to crawl easily data from the Carbon Disclosure Project website, as a need for a research project conducted by Laura Mazzola (https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-mazzola-94347110b/). 

This is just a "toy model" to be developed into a more general Crawler app. It is intended to help gather public data faster, avoiding inutile hard work.

Also, it proposes a nice boilerplate for crawling apps, possibly with integration with Python resources.
